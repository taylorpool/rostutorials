Packages in ROS are catkin packages.
packages must have their own folders. No nested packages!

Packages need a package.xml file.
  this file defines package properties like name,
    version number, author, etc.
  package dependencies are declared in package.xml. If
    not, then the package will not work correctly when
    distributed to others.
    see samplepackage.xml in this directory for more detail.
Packages need a CMakeLists.txt file

To create a package use catkin_create_pkg [package name] [depend1] [depend2]

In the packages.xml file we find information about the package like the name
and who is maintaining the package.

We also find a list of all dependencies broken up by class.

build_depend
Means that they are availible at build time
buildtool_depend
Means that the package is used to build this package
exec_depend
Means that we can access the package dependencies during run time
test_depend
