Packages in ROS are catkin packages.
packages must have their own folders. No nested packages!

Packages need a package.xml file.
  this file defines package properties like name,
    version number, author, etc.
  package dependencies are declared in package.xml. If
    not, then the package will not work correctly when
    distributed to others.
    see samplepackage.xml in this directory for more detail.
Packages need a CMakeLists.txt file

To create a package use catkin_create_pkg [package name] [depend1] [depend2]
